The Healthcare Recommendation System aims to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into healthcare to improve patient care, operational efficiency, and cost management. The system leverages machine learning models to analyze patient symptoms, predict diseases, and recommend appropriate treatments. Key components include predictive analytics, personalized medicine, and AI-driven decision support systems. 
The project also addresses challenges such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and interoperability
